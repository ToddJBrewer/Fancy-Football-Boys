# What are we trying to accomplish?
-Accurately predict weekly future fantasy football performance for any given offense skill-position player in the NFL 

-Data will be scraped from footballdb.com

#TODO
1. figure out how to scrape basic fantasy football data
2. to start, all data for 2021
3. initially, only QB
variables:
-avg points for the player per game
-avg points earned for that position against the defense
-opponent overall def ranking for 2021
-home vs. away

build a model for these 4 variables

things needed in the future: 
more data for weather, expand to all skill positions not just QB 
more variables like weather, w/l, other ff predictions, playoff eligibility, won/lost last game, overall team record, def avg score
unsure about algos until we have a better idea of data
possible clustering to put similar players in "tiers" with kmeans or other algo
as more football is played, can we use new data to make our model more accurate?
